# CyberSec Books Collection: Now on Notion! 📚

Hi everyone 👋,

I've been maintaining this repository for a while now to provide a collection of **free cybersecurity books**.

Initially, I was using Git LFS (Large File Storage) to manage the larger PDF files. However, with the current limitations of LFS in 2025, I'm excited to announce that I'm migrating all the books to a **new Notion page**! 🎉

You can now find the complete collection here:
[https://security-books.notion.site/](https://security-books.notion.site/) ✌️

This move to Notion will make the collection even more accessible and easier to navigate for everyone. Thank you, and I hope this new home for the collection helps everyone on their cybersecurity journey! ✨
